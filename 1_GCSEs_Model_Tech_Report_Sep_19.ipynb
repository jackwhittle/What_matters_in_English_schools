Also, there is a shortage of languages teachers.  Given these factors, and the pressure on schools to meet Progress 8 measures, only the most able children will be steered towards taking a language, and specifically those in schools with good language teachers. <br />\n",
    "    **Measure**: The proportion of children in High, Medium and Low attainment categories at 11 (KS2) who take at least one language at GCSE.  <br />\n",
    "    However, this does not necessarily explain why taking a language is a good predictor of **progress** rather than raw academic attainment.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    Whilst this accounts for the link between the two factors, it does not explain **why** studying a language increases someone's chances of making more progress than their peers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "iii) **The act of learning a language enables the development of more advanced cognitive functioning than learning other subjects, and that cognitive functioning aids progress in other subjects**.  This would explain why there is a difference in overall progress between those taking a subject at 16 vs those who have not, but is a difficult hypothesis to test.\n",
    "    \n",
    "iv) **The quality of teaching has the biggest impact, and high quality teachers work with other high quality teachers** Teaching quality is a factor not included in the models I have created, because data on it is very difficult to attain.  However, given that there is a shortage of teachers in languages, and the pressure on schools to achieve as high a Progress 8 score as possible, it is likely that children steered towards taking a language at GCSE will have a good quality teacher.  In addition, high quality professionals in any field will want to work alongside people of a similar ability, which would help to explain why children make better than average progress in other subjects too.<br />\n",
    "    This would be a difficult hypothesis to test, but is supported by looking at the progress that children make in selective schools.<br />\n",
